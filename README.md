## Authentication

deezer-dl uses Deezer's ARL cookie for authentication. To obtain it:

1. Log in to [deezer.com](https://www.deezer.com) in your browser
2. Open Developer Tools (`F12`)
3. Go to **Application** > **Cookies** > `https://www.deezer.com`
4. Copy the value of the `arl` cookie

On first launch, the CLI will prompt you to enter your ARL. It is then stored locally at `~/.config/deezer-dl/.arl` for subsequent sessions.

To clear your credentials:

```bash
deezer-dl logout
```

## Architecture

```
src/
  main.rs      CLI entry point, argument parsing, interactive mode
  api.rs       Deezer GW (internal) API + public API + media URL client
  auth.rs      ARL-based login, persistent credential storage
  crypto.rs    Blowfish CBC decryption, AES-128-ECB stream path, key generation
  download.rs  Track/playlist/favorites/artist download orchestration
  models.rs    Data structures (tracks, playlists, albums, formats)
```

### Technical Details

- **GW API**: `http://www.deezer.com/ajax/gw-light.php` — internal API for track metadata, playlists, user data
- **Public API**: `https://api.deezer.com` — artist search, track info
- **Media API**: `https://media.deezer.com/v1/get_url` — authenticated track stream URLs
- **Decryption**: Blowfish CBC with per-track key derived from `MD5(track_id) XOR secret`, IV `[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`
- **Stream format**: every 6144 bytes (2048 * 3), the first 2048 bytes are Blowfish-encrypted

## Tech Stack

- **Rust** (edition 2024)
- **tokio** — async runtime
- **reqwest** — HTTP client with cookie jar
- **clap** — CLI argument parsing
- **dialoguer** — interactive prompts and selection menus
- **indicatif** — progress bars
- **blowfish** / **cbc** — stream decryption
- **aes** — AES-128-ECB for URL path generation
- **md-5** — MD5 hashing for key derivation
